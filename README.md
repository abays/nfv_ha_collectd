# nfv_ha_collectd
Collectd plugin for network interface service assurance monitoring

**INSTALL**
1. Clone this repo
2. Clone https://github.com/collectd/collectd.git
3. Move collectd.conf, configure.ac and Makefile.am from nfv_ha_collectd to collectd.  If you're concerned about wiping out changes in the (probably) more-up-to-date collectd repo's configure.ac and Makefile.am files, you can manually inject the "netlink2" contents from the files in this repo into the files from the collectd repo.  Just "grep -i netlink2" against this repo's files and you'll get an idea how you'll need to update the corresponding collectd repo versions.
4. Move netlink2.c to collectd/src
5. yum install -y flex bison libtool libmnl libmnl-devel gcc-c++
6. yum install -y ftp://195.220.108.108/linux/remi/enterprise/7/remi/x86_64/librdkafka-0.9.4-1.el7.remi.x86_64.rpm
7. Clone https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka.git
8. cd ~/librdkafka
9. ./configure
10. make
11. make install
12. cd ~/collectd
13. ./build.sh
14. ./configure
15. make
16. make install

**CONFIGURE**
1. cd ~/collectd
2. vi collectd.conf
3. Change the "Interface" key's associated value in the netlink2 section to target the interface you wish to monitor.  If desired, you can simply add multiple "Interface interface" lines to monitor multiple interfaces.
4. Change the "Property" "metadata.broker.list" key's associated value in the write_kafka section to the IP and port of your Kafka broker.  You don't necessarily have to use this plugin if you're fine with just seeing events in the syslog and collectd log.

**RUN**
1. cd ~/collectd
2. ./collectd -C collectd.conf -f
3. In another terminal, ifdown/ifup the interfaces you have chosen to monitor.
4. Check /var/log/messages and /var/log/collectd.log to see the plugin report the interface status.
